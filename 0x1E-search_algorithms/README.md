## Learning Objectives
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

- What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
- [x] O(n) : This means that the time it takes to find an element in the array increases linearly with the size of the array.
- What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?
- [x] O(1) : This is because the algorithm only requires one extra variable (the index) which does not depend on the size of the array.This is because the algorithm only requires one extra variable (the index) which does not depend on the size of the array.
- What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
- [x] O(log(n)) represents log(n)
- What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
- [x] O(1) : It only requires a single variable (an integer) to store the index of the middle element. The only additional space used is the stack space for the recursive calls, which is O(log n).
- What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
- [x] O(nm) represents n*m : This is because the function will allocate memory for an array of n pointers, each of which points to an array of m integers. Therefore, the total amount of memory allocated is nm integers.
